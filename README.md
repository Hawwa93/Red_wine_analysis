# Red Wine Analysis

### Poject overwiew
This is a group project that aims to provide insights into various aspects of red wine data, including pricing, ratings, production trends, and geographical distribution. It involves a combination of data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis to derive meaningful conclusions from the dataset.

### Data sources 
The data used in this project is the redwine data downloaded from kaggle and was souced from the vivino data base. it contains detailed information on redwine sales and production accorss various geaographical regions.

### Tools
- Python Programming
- Jupyter notebook

### Description
This project was carried out through the five data analytis steps given below:
1. Data collectiong: 
The Red wine data was downloaded from kaggle which was sourced from the vivino database
2. Data Exploration:
Investigation of the dataset, checking for null values, duplicates, and data types to ensure accurate analysis.
3. Data Cleaning:
Rows with empty values were dropped during this stage to ensure data integrity.
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
This crucial stage involves:
* Creating visualizations to understand the distribution of variables.
* Calculating summary statistics to gain insights into the dataset.
* Exploring relationships between different variables.
* Identifying trends and patterns in the data.
5. Data Communication:
In this phase, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the Red wine dataset, culminating in the creation of a blog post 
and presentation slides attached to the notebook. These materials serve to discuss  key insights derived from the Red wine analysis, providing 
a summarized overview of the findings.

### Limitations
I had to remove rows with  nan values from from my data set because they would have affected the accuracy of my  conclusion from the analysis.
